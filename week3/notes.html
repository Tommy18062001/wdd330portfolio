    <h1>Readings and Notes</h1>

    <h2>Object method ‘This’</h2>
<p>It is a way for an object method to access the information stored in the object. The value of this is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context.
</p>
<h2>Chapter 5: Objects</h2>
<h3>An object in JS is a self-contained set of related values and functions. We can think about it as a dictionary. 
    </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>It can inherit properties from other objects.</li>
        <li>An object can contain other objects (Nested objects)</li>
        <li>Arrays and functions are one of the main examples of built-in objects</li>
        <li>Objects are mutable</li>
    </ul>
    
<h3>Object literal: It’s an object that is created directly in the language by wrapping all its properties and methods in curly braces {}
    There is two ways to create it: </h3>

<ul>
    <li>Object literal notation (recommended)</li>
    <li>Construction function</li>
</ul>

<h3>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): It is a popular lightweight data-storage format that is used for data serialization and configuration.  JSON is a string representation of the object literal notation that we have just seen
    Others objects: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Math Object</li>
        <li>Date Object </li>
        <li>RegEx Object (to study more) is a pattern that can be used to search or modify strings</li>
    </ul>

<h3>RegEx Special Character:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>. matches any character </li>
    <li>\w matches any word character, and is equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_] </li>
    <li>\W matches any non-word character, and is equivalent to [^A-Za-z0-9_] </li>
        <li>\d matches any digit character, and is equivalent to [0-9] </li>
            <li>\D matches any non-digit character, and is equivalent to [^0-9] </li>
                <li>\s matches any whitespace character, and is equivalent to [ \t\r\n\f] </li>
                    <li>\S matches any non-whitespace character, and is equivalent to [^ \t\r\n\f]</li>
</ul>



<h3>RegEx Modifiers:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>? matches zero or one occurrence of the pattern </li>
        <li>* matches zero or more occurrences of the pattern </li>
            <li>+ matches one or more occurrences of the pattern</li>
                <li>{n} matches n occurrences of the pattern</li>
                    <li>{n,} matches at least n occurrences of the pattern </li>
                        <li>{,m} matches at most m occurrences of the pattern </li>
                            <li>{n,m} matches at least n and at most m occurrences of the pattern </li>
                                <li>^ specifies that the pattern must come at the beginning </li>
                                    <li>$ specifies that the pattern must come at the end</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 6: The Documet Model Objects DOM</h2>
<ul>
    <li>DOM allows you to access elements of a web page and enable interaction with the page. It represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure </li>
        <li>DOM API provides several methods to access any element which will return a node object or a node list. The same way, it also has setter methods that can be used to view, update or even remove content </li>
        
            <li>CreateTextNode: It creates a text node that can be append to a parent node like paragraph, …
        </li>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 7: Events</h2>
<p>Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, pressing a key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs that our program can detect and then respond to.
</p>
<h3>Event listeners</h3>
 <ul>
     <li>It’s a like setting a notification that will respond appropriately when a specific even happens <br>
        Example: document.body.addEventListener(“click”, doSomething);</li>
        <li>Old Event Handlers: Another method of dealing with events. Using event handler that all node objects have. <br>
            Example: document.onclick = function (){ console.log(“You clicked!”); }
            </li>
 </ul>



<h3>Event Objects</h3>
<p>Every time an event occurs, the callback function is called. This function is automatically passed an event object as a parameter that contains information about the event.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    event.type: returns the type of event that occurred, such as click</li>
    <li>event.target: returns a reference to the node that fired the event.</li>
        <li>event.screenX and event.screenY: show the number of pixels from the left and top of the screen respectively where the event took place.</li>
            <li>event.which:  returns which mouse button or key was pressed
</li></ul>

<h3>Type of Events</h3>
<p>There are several type of events but here are one of the most common:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Mouse Events</li>
	<li>Keyboard Events</li>
	<li>Touch Events
    </li>
    
</ul>

<h3>Event propagation</h3>
<p>It is the order that the events fire on each element. There are two forms of event propagation: 
</p>	
<ul>
    <li>Bubbling (default behavior): is when the event fires on the element clicked on first, then bubbles up the document tree, firing an event on each parent element until it reaches the root node.</li>
        <li>Capturing: starts by firing an event on the root element, then propagates downwards, firing an event on each child element until it reaches the target element that was clicked on
        </li>
</ul>

<h3>Stopping the Bubbling Phase</h3>
<p>It can be stopped from occurring by adding the event.stopPropagation() method into the callback function.
</p>

<h3>Event delegation</h3>
<p>can be used to attach an event listener to a parent element in order to capture events that happen to its child element
</p>
<p>preventDefault(): It prevents the default behavior of an elements
