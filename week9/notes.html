  <h1>W08: Readings and Notes</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 9: Window Object</h2>
  <p>
    The window object represents the browser window that contains a web page.
  </p>

  <h3>The Browser Object Model:</h3>
  <p>
    BOM for short is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer
    screen.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Going Global:
      Global variables are actual properties of a global object. In a browser environment, the global object is the
      window object.
    </li>
    <li>
      Dialogs:
      There are few types of dialogs like: alert(), confirm(), and prompt(). They are also window objects.

    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Browser Information:</h3>
  <p>
    The window object has a number of properties and methods that provide information about the user’s browser.
  </p>

  <h4>Which Browser?</h4>
  <p>
    window.navigator.userAgent – This property will return information about the browser and operating system being
    used.
  </p>
  <h4>Location, Location, Location</h4>
  <p>
    The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>window.location.href: return the full URL as a string</li>
    <li>window.location.protocol: return the protocol used (such as https, pop2, ftp etc.)</li>
    <li>window.location.host: returns the domain of the current URL and the port number</li>
    <li>window.location.port: returns the port number</li>
    <li>window.location.pathname: returns a string of the path that follows the domain</li>
    <li>window.location.search: returns a string that starts with a “?” followed by the query string parameters</li>
    <li>window.location.hash: returns a string that starts with a “#” followed by the fragment identifiers</li>
    <li>window.location.origin: returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page originated
      from</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some methods of the window.location object:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>window.location.reload(): Force a reload of the current page.</li>
    <li>window.location.assign(): Load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter</li>
    <li>window.location.replace(): Same as the window.location.assign() method, except that the current page will not be
      stored in the session history, so the user will be unable to navigate back to it using the back button.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Browser History</h3>
  <p>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current
    browser session.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>window.history.lenght: shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current page.</li>
    <li>window.history.go(): used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page</li>
    <li>window.history.forward(): navigate forwards by one page.</li>
    <li>window.history.back(): backwards by one page respectively</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Controlling Windows
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>window.open(): open a new window. It takes URL as a parameter with few arguments.
      Example: window.open(‘https://sitepoint.com’,‘SitePoint’,‘width=400, ↵height=400,resizable=yes’)</li>
    <li>window.close(): In the other hand, this method is used to close a window</li>
    <li>window.move(): move a window depending on the argument given (X, Y)</li>
    <li>window.resizeTo(): Resize window’s dimensions by taking two parameters that specify the width and height</li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Screen Information
  </h3>
  <p> The window.screen object contains information about the screen that the browser is displayed on.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>window.screen.height</li>
    <li>window.screen.width</li>
    <li>window.screen.availWidth</li>
    <li>window.screen.availHeight</li>
    <li>window.screen.colorDepth: used to find the color bit depth of the user’s monitor</li>

  </ul>

  <h3> The Document Object
  </h3>
  <p>Each window object contains a document object. This object has properties and methods that deal with the page that
    has been loaded into the window.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>document.write(): writes a string of text to the page.
      This is an archaic method of writing text to the document and should be avoided.
    <li>document.cookie: create a cookie</li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Cookies:
  </h3>
  <p>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. They are also limited to storing up to 4KB of
    data, although 20 cookies are allowed per domain, which can add up to quite a lot of data.
    Their use for data storage is starting to be replaced in many cases by the new HTML5 localStorage API as it allows
    more data to be stored
    The method used to deal with cookies is document.cookie</p>
  <h3>Timing Functions</h3>
  <p>The window object provides some useful methods for scheduling the execution of a function and for repeatedly
    executing functions at regular intervals
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds
      as its second parameter</li>
    <li>window.clearTimeout()</li>
    <li>window.setInterval() method works in a similar way to setTimeout except that it will continue to invoke the
      callback function after every given number of milliseconds.</li>
    <li>window.clearInterval()</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Animation</h3>
  <p>The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page. But after, a new method
    has been developed. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>window.requestAnimationFrame(): this works in much the same way as the window.setInterval() method, although it
      has a number of improvements to optimize its performance.</li>
    <li>window.cancelAnimationFrame()</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Chapter 14: HTML5 APIs</h2>
  <p>HTML5 is the latest iteration of the Hypertext Markup Language used to create web pages. This version goes beyond
    the actual markup language, however, and brings together a number of related technologies such as CSS and
    JavaScript.
  </p>
  <h3>The data- Attribute:</h3>
  <p>It is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. They’re also
    private to a page, so shouldn’t be used by an external service: their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript
    program.
  </p>
  <p>The names of these attributes can be decided by the developer, but they must use the following format: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>start with data </li>
    <li>contain only lowercase letters </li>
    <li>include an optional string value </li>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>If a data- attribute’s name contains hyphens, they are replaced with camel-case notation, so data-max-length would
    be accessed using maxLength.
  </p>
  <p>Data attributes provide a convenient way of adding data directly into the HTML markup, enabling a richer user
    experience.</p>

  <h3> HTML5 APIs </h3>
  <p>The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to the hardware, such as cameras,
    batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card. Hardware evolves quickly and APIs are frequently introduced to give
    developers access and control new features that appear in the latest devices.
    Due to the ever-changing nature of most APIs, it is still best practice to use object-detection tests before using
    any of the API methods.</p>

  <h4>HTML5 Web Storage</h4>
  <p>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but has
    fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use.
  </p>
  <p>The Web Storage API has some crucial differences with cookies: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>information stored is not shared with the server on every request </li>
    <li>information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the same) </li>
    <li>storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If a browser supports the Web Storage API the window object will have a property called localStorage, which is a
    native object with a number of properties and methods used to store data.
  </p>
  <p>Every time a value is saved to local storage, a storage event is fired. The event object sent by the event listener
    to the callback has a number of properties that provide information about the updated item:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>key tells us the key of the item that changed</li>
    <li>newValue tells us the new value to which it has been changed </li>
    <li>oldValue tells us the previous value before it was changed </li>
    <li>storageArea tells us if it is stored in local or session storage</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Geolocation
  </h4>
  <p>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device.</p>
  <p>This has a method. Here are some example</p>
  <ul>
    <li>getCurrentPosition() that will return a position object to a specified function, called youAreHere() </li>
    <li>clearWatch() method can be used to stop the callback being called, using the ID of the watch as an argument</li>
  </ul>
  <p> There are many other properties: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>position.speed: returns the ground speed of the device in meters per second</li>
    <li>position.altitude: returns an estimate of the device’s altitude in meters above the WGS84 ellipsoid, which is a
      standard measurement for the center of the Earth</li>
    <li>position.headin: returns the direction the device is moving in as a bearing</li>
    <li>position.timestamp property returns the time that the position information was recorded</li>
    <li>position.accuracy property returns the accuracy of the latitude and longitude properties in meters</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Web Workers</h4>
  <p>We saw in earlier chapters that JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning that only one process can run at
    one time. Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>To get started, we need to use the Worker() constructor function to create a new worker
  </p>
  <p>Web workers use the concept of messages to communicate back and forth between the main script and worker script.
    (use of the method postMessage())
  </p>
  <p>When a worker has completed its task, it can be stopped using the terminate() method or close () inside the script
  </p>

  <h4>Shared Web Workers
  </h4>
  <p>The examples we have seen so far are known as dedicated web workers. These are linked to the script that loaded the
    worker and are unable to be used by another script. You can also create shared web workers that allow lots of
    different scripts on the same domain to access the same worker object.
  </p>
  <p>They are a useful feature that help to keep sites responsive, even when complicated operations are being carried
    out.
  </p>
  <h4>Multimedia</h4>
  <p>Before HTML5 it was notoriously difficult to display audio and video in browsers, and plugins such as Flash often
    had to be used. HTML5 introduced the and tags used to insert audio and video clips into a web page. It also
    introduced a Media API for controlling the playback of the clips using JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>Audio and video elements have a number of properties and methods to control the playback of the clip.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>play() method will start the clip playing from its current position</li>
    <li>pause() method will pause the clip at its current position</li>
    <li>volume property is a number that can be used to set the audio volume </li>
    <li>muted property is a Boolean value that can be used to mute the audio</li>
    <li>currentTime property is a number value that can be used to jump to another part of the clip</li>
    <li>playbackRate property is used to fast-forward or rewind the clip by changing its value. A value of 1 is playback
      at normal speed</li>
    <li>loop property is a Boolean value that can be set to true to make the clip repeat in a loop</li>
    <li>duration property can be used to see how long the clip lasts</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Other APIs </h4>
  <p>The list of APIs is constantly growing, and include APIs for accessing a device’s camera, using WebSockets for
    multiple simultaneous connections, uploading files, accessing the battery status, handling push notifications,
    building drag and drop functionality, creating 3D effects with WebGL, and many more! A comprehensive list of HTML5
    APIs can be found at the Mozilla Developer Network.
  </p>
  <h4>Drawing with Canvas
  </h4>
  <p>The canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn onto a web page in real time using JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>A canvas element is a rectangular element on the web page. It has a coordinate system that starts at (0,0) in the
    top-left corner. To add a canvas element to a page, the tag is used specifying a height and width.
  </p>
  <p>Method and properties:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>getContext() method is used to access the context</li>
    <li>The fill and stroke colors can be changed by assigning a CSS color to the fillStyle and strokeStyle properties
      respectively</li>
    <li>fillRect() method is used to draw a filled-in rectangle.</li>
    <li>strokeRect() method works in the same way, but produces a rectangle that is not filled in</li>
    <li>moveTo() and lineTo() is used to draw</li>
    <li>stroke(): nothing will be displayed on the screen unless this method is called</li>
    <li>arc() method is used to draw an arc of a given radius from a particular point</li>
    <li>fillText() method is used to write text onto the canvas</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Shims and Polyfills
  </h4>
  <p>HTML5 APIs progress at a rapid rate―new APIs are constantly being introduced and existing APIs often change. Modern
    browsers are very quick to update and implement many of the changes, but you can’t always guarantee that users will
    have the most up-to date browser. This is where a shim or a polyfill comes in handy. These are libraries of code
    that allow you to use the APIs as usual; they then fill in the necessary code that not provided natively by the
    user’s browser.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shim: is a piece of code that adds some missing functionality to a browser, although the implementation method
      may be differ slightly from the standard API. </li>
    <li>polyfill is a shim that achieves the same functionality while also using the API commands that would be used if
      the feature was supported natively.
    </li>
  </ul>
